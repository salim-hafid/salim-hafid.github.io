# About
I am a currently a post-doctoral researcher at the [medialab](https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/en/) at [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/en/). 

Previously, I did a PhD in Computer Science at [LIRMM](https://www.lirmm.fr/lirmm-en/), University of Montpellier in France, and was a visiting student at [GESIS](https://www.gesis.org/en/home) (Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences) in Germany. 

My research is situated at the intersection of three scientific fields: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP); Social Choice Theory; and Political Science. It currently focuses on the development of novel hybrid AI models for the study of digital public spaces (social media, online press, and debate platforms). Current applications of my research are mainly situated in Digital Democracy (with use-cases such as AI-assisted moderation of citizen deliberations, algorithmic audits of digital platforms) and Computational Journalism (with use-cases such as automated fact-checking, source-retrieval, modeling and analysis of online debates).
