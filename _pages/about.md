# About
I am a currently a post-doctoral researcher at the [medialab](https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/en/) at [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/en/). 

My research is situated at the intersection of three scientific fields: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP); Social Choice Theory; and Political Science. It focuses on the study, processing and moderation of "online discourse", seen as discourse from social media, online press, and debate platforms. Its applications are mainly situated in Digital Democracy (e.g., regulation of digital public spaces, analysis of online debates) and Computational Journalism (e.g., fact-checking).
